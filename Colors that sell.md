# Red - Impulsive purchases
Red triggers action. If you’ve already primed someone to buy with great design (that isn’t all bright red), and solid copy, then your red ‘buy now’ buttons can work great.

**Where can you see it in action?**

Every bricks-and-mortar sale ever: all sales signs are red, and it’s not just a convention. By the time Black Friday rolls around, people are already geared up to go find something at 99% off and buy the heck out of it. The trigger they need is to buy from this store rather than that one, so sales signs are bright, urgent, act-now red.

**Where should you use it?**

Red is more effective for impulse purchases, so it’s a common buy button choice on ecommerce websites. But it’s more effective for B2B software vendors too. When HubSpot A/B tested CTA button color for Performable, red out-converted green by 21%.
